::Loops
There are 3 kinds of loops which would you like to know about?
[[For Loops@For]]
[[While Loops@While]]
[[Do While Loops@DoWhile]]

::For
The for loops looks like:
for (int i=0;i<10;i++)
This will run 10 times
[[Start@Start]]

::While
The while loops looks like:
int i=0;
while (i++ < 10)
{

}
This will run 10 times
[[Start@Start]]

::DoWhile
The do while loops looks like:
int i=0;
do
{

}
while (i++ < 10);
This will run 10 times
This is the only postfix loop structure

::If
Ooo, If statements are fun. They can evaluate a condition and select a line of code to run
[[More_If_Statements@MoreIf]]

If statements are classified as selection statements. 
Other forms include the switch statement and the short-hand-if, or tertiary operator.
